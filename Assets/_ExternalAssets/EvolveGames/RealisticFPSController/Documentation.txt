Realistic FPS Controller
    by Evolve Games
------------------------

FPS Controller:
• FPS Controller is the Controller itself which you no longer have to set.
• just paste into the scene from the folder: Assets/EvolveGames/RealisticFPSController/PlayerController

Viewpoint:
• Viewpoint is used to show an icon with text in the game...
• For prefabs you have to set what you want it to write and if so what kind of icon you want... folder: Assets/EvolveGames/RealisticFPSController/Prefabs/Viewpoint

3D:
• Other 3D models are in the folder: Assets/EvolveGames/RealisticFPSController/Prefabs

Demo:
• Scene: Assets/EvolveGames/RealisticFPSController/Scenes/DemoScene
• Everything is set in the demo, just turn on the scene and you're done...
• The demo is used to view the functions and find out, what and how it works... :)

Setup:
• You drag the Player Controller to the scene and you're done...
• You have Prefabs in Assets/EvolveGames/RealisticFPSController/Prefabs and you use this items in the scene.
• That will be all you need...

Otherwise you will find everything in the given scripts.. :)
